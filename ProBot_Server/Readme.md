To control the Probots  we are using webpage build with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). This code is based on [Flask-Starter](https://github.com/samgclarke/flask-starter).

With this interface, the user can see the ProBots that are avaiable. After choose one ProBot, the user can see some useful information related to that ProBot like the angle or the battery percentage.

The admin can also initialize the mainRoutine and shutdown the BeagleBone.
