To control the Probots  we are using webpage build with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). This code is based on [Flask-Starter](https://github.com/samgclarke/flask-starter) with some chances made by [Andr√© Braga](https://github.com/andbraga).

With this interface, we can see the ProBot's that are avaiable and the percentage of battery of each one.
