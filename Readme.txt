Self Balancing Robot with BeagleBone Black


Our objective is to build a protest robot with 1,50m high with the BeagleBone Black. For that, we are using packetized serial protocol to comunicate with the Sabertooth Controller. The Sabertooth controls the two EMG49 motors.To find it's angle it uses the MPU6050 that uses an I2C connection with all the data from an accelerometer and a gyroscope.
