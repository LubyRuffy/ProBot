Greetings, this version of the board is an evolution from what we already have, but it's not tested yet, if you find any problem, please report.
The board have an input for 5V in the top (Ethernet port side) to power the board and a 24V input to monitor the battery voltage.

To control, we have two PWM ouputs one for each controller if used the same as us and an output for the Sabertooth 2X25A.

There are also two inputs for the encoders with the usual order A, Vcc, B, empty, Gnd. You need to have atention on wich you connect to that the robot doesn't go in the wrong way.

This shield is ready to put the MPU6050 acelerometer.
